## ðŸ”¥ Announcement: League of Robot Runners - Main Round is Here! ðŸ”¥ - 28 Aug 2023

We're thrilled to announce that the main round of the League of Robot Runners competition is just around the corner, and we're bringing you exciting updates and challenges that will put your algorithmic skills and inovations to the ultimate test!

### New Challenges Await:
In response to the incredible enthusiasm and dedication from the community, we've ramped up the excitement in this main round with a diverse array of challenges. Brace yourselves for the following changes across 10 different instances:
- 5 Instances with High Agent Density on Random Maps: Prepare to push your algorithms to the limit as you navigate agents through congested spaces on randomly generated maps. Can you maintain order in chaos?
- 2 Instances on Medium-Sized City Maps: As the number of agents increases, can you adapt and strategize effectively to ensure smooth agent movement through urban landscapes?
- 3 Instances on Large Game, Sortation, and Warehouse Maps: These challenges are designed to truly test your algorithm as you coordinate agents in both congested environments and large-scale scenarios.

### Enhanced Website Features:
You can now explore both the newest leaderboard and the archived test round leaderboard. The website always reminds the deadline of current round. Additionally, the my submission panel now provides more details to each of your submissions.

### Updated Start-Kit (Version 1.1.1):
To ensure a smooth experience for all participants, we've rolled out an update to the Start-kit. This version includes important bug fixes and documentation improvements:

- Bug Fixes: We've addressed bugs regarding map symbol and agent out of map boundary issue. 

- Enhanced README: We've improved the explanation of program inputs, file formats and dependencies in the documentation. Furthermore, Windows users will find detailed instructions to use our Start-kit within WSL in the updated README, ensuring that everyone can get started without any hiccups.

- More Example Instances: New instances are provided in the Starti-Kit to cover a wide range of challenging problems and fixed known issues in existing problems.

### Important Deadlines: 
Keep in mind the deadline for the main round is November 30th!
