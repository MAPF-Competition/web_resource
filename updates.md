Dear Participants and Enthusiasts,

We're thrilled to announce that the main round of the League of Robot Runners competition is just around the corner, and we're bringing you exciting updates and challenges that will put your algorithmic skills and inovations to the ultimate test!

### Main Round Approaching:
Get ready to dive into the heart of the competition as the main round is set to kick off now. This is your chance to showcase your strategic thinking and coordination abilities in a series of thrilling challenges.

### New Challenges Await:
In response to the incredible enthusiasm and dedication from the community, we've ramped up the excitement in this main round with a diverse array of challenges. Brace yourselves for the following changes across 10 different instances:
> - 5 Instances with High Agent Density on Random Maps: Prepare to push your coordination skills to the limit as you navigate agents through congested spaces on randomly generated maps. Can you maintain order in chaos?
> - 2 Instances on Medium-Sized City Maps: As the number of agents increases, can you adapt and strategize effectively to ensure smooth agent movement through urban landscapes?
> - 3 Instances on Large Game, Sortation, and Warehouse Maps: These challenges are designed to truly test your algorithm as you coordinate agents in both congested environments and large-scale scenarios.

### Enhanced Website Features:
You can now explore the archived submissions from the test round, giving you valuable insights into various strategies.

### Updated Start-Kit (Version 1.1.1):
To ensure a smooth experience for all participants, we've rolled out an update to the Start-kit. This version includes important bug fixes and documentation improvements:

Bug Fixes: We've addressed a bug that was causing issues when agents attempted to move to the outside of the map. 

Enhanced README: We understand the importance of clarity in understanding the competition framework. In response to your feedback, we've revamped our documentation to provide explicit and concise instructions. We've provided a clear explanation of program inputs and file formats in the documentation. Furthermore, Windows users will find detailed instructions to use our Start-kit within WSL in the updated README, ensuring that everyone can get started without any hiccups.

More Example Instances: New instances are provided in Starti-Kit to cover a wide range of challenging problems.


### Important Deadlines: 
Keep in mind the deadline for the main round is November 30th!
