## Join the Competition ![r10](landing_page_resource/robots/r10_s.png)

Login to the [competition website](http://www.leagueofrobotrunners.org/submission) with a GitHub account, and we will automatically create a private GitHub submission repo for you.

The repo will be the place that you submit codes to. In the `My Submission` page, you can click `My Repo` to open your GitHub submission repo, which contains a copy of start kit implementation.

To join the competition as a team, only one memeber of the team need to login to the competition website. Once login, `Settings` is available in the menu bar, which navigates to the `Settings` page. You can add team members and their contacts there.

## Clone Your Submission Repo

Find the `<private git link>` to your private repo by clicking `Shown Git Link` in the `My Submission` page. Then clone your submission repo to your local machine. The repo contains starter code to help you prepare your submission.

```
$ git clone <private git link>
```
