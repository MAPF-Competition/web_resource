## Goals of the Competition

The League of Robot Runners is a competition series to foster and advance research areas in the areas of Multi-Agent Path Finding ([MAPF](https://mapf.info)) and Task Scheduling. LoRR aims to: 

> - Identify the core challenges for solving MAPF;
> - Develop suitable benchmark instances;
> - Evaluate algorithmic performance in the area; and
> - Track the state-of-the-art.
 
The competition provides a standardised system to develop, evaluate and compare algorithmic techniques. 
[Submissions](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/Code-Archive), [solutions and problem instances](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/Benchmark-Archive) from the competition are open sourced to lower barriers, promote dissemination and enable further advancements.

## Competition Series

### LoRR 2023
The first edition of the League of Robot Runners tackled two main challenges: 

> - **Turn actions:** 
        In MAPF, robots are often simplified as rotationally invariant
        agents, with unit action costs. There is a notable gap between such 
        models and real applications, where turn actions can [substantially
        increase](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/SOCS/article/view/27290)
        achieved execution costs. 
>
> - **Online lifelong problem:**
        In MAPF, the problem is often one-shot and solved entirely offline. Yet,
        real applications are *lifelong* and *online*:  agents receive new tasks after finishing their tasks, and they must be constantly [planned and
        replanned](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/31534),
        so as to [maximise
        throughput](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/30054).

This competition received a total of **825 submissions** from **25 teams worldwide**. For more details about the setup, results and resources, please visit the [2023 Competition Snapshot Site](https://2023.leagueofrobotrunners.org/).

### LoRR 2024
In 2024, The League of Robot Runners combines **Path planning and Task scheduling**. 
This setup more accurately reflect challenges faced by real-world applications, where
the decision of which robot completes which task can have a substantial impact
on the throughput objective.
