## Start Kit

The start kit is a code harness that you must interface with when developing your planner. Please refer to the [instructions](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/Start-Kit/blob/main/README.md) for more details.

Further documentation, to help you [prepare your planner](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/Start-Kit/blob/main/Prepare_Your_Planner.md) and details about the [submission process](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/Start-Kit/blob/main/Submission_Instruction.md) are also available.

## Test maps and example problems

The [set of maps](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/Start-Kit/tree/main/example_problems)that you will be evaluated on are revealed as part of the competition. You can refer to these maps during development of your planner and you can compute (offline) auxiliary data per map that can be uploaded as part of your submission. 

We have also generated example problems (errands) of the type that will be used to evaluate your submission. The evaluation instances are hidden during the competition but will be made available. Please refer to the [Input Output Format](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/Start-Kit/blob/main/Input_Output_Format.md) specification if you would like to generate your own modified instances for your own local testing (e.g., you might find it helpful to modify the examples in order to test with different numbers of agents).
