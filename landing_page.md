Weâ€™re very excited to announce the inaugural League of Robot Runners (LoRR) competition, and we invite you to participate! 

The LoRR competition offers a unique opportunity to tackle one of the most complex logistic optimization challenges - the coordination of multiple moving robots in a variety of environments. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to solve these variants of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problems as efficiently as possible, operating within defined computational constraints. Participating in this competition means not only demonstrating your skills against the best in the field but also contributing to the establishment of new benchmarks and algorithmic baselines. You'll have the chance to make a tangible impact on the progression of the broader MAPF field, with the possibility of your innovative solutions and source codes being shared with the wider community. Moreover, your involvement will help increase attention to this critical problem and contribute to the growth of our community. Don't miss this chance to be a part of an exciting challenge that's driving the next wave of advancements in the field. Sign up today and make your mark in the first-ever LoRR competition!
