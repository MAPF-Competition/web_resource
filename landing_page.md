## Introduction ![r8](./external_page_resource/robots/r8_s.jpg)

The League of Robot Runners, sponsored by Amazon Robotics, is a **competition** series where participants tackle the **core combinatorial challenges** found in cooperative multi-robot coordination problems: **agent dynamic ü§ñ**, **lifelong planning ‚ôªÔ∏è**, **real-time execution ‚è≥**, and **task assignment üéØ**. These challenges are important for industrial applications such as warehouse logistics, transportation and advanced manufacturing.

## The Mission ![r1](./external_page_resource/robots/r1_s.png)
<!-- What we ask you to do, what you get if you do well, what are the important dates -->
<!-- ![demo](./external_page_resource/images/mission.jpg) -->

üöÄ Coordinate thousands of robots in a busy warehouse! Participants are asked to develop algorithms that assign tasks to a team of robots and then coordinate the robots to complete their assigned tasks as quickly as possible and collision-free.

 The competition recognises distinguished performance in three distinct categories:

> - **üèáüèº Path Planning Track**: Participants develop algorithms that coordinate a team of robots to complete assigned tasks, given a default task scheduler.
> - **üìã Task Scheduling Track**: Participants develop algorithms that schedule tasks to a team of robots, given a default path planner coordinates the robots.
> - **üèÅ Combined Track**: Participants develop both path planning and task scheduling algorithms.


üõ†Ô∏è The competition provides a standardised system to develop, evaluate, and compare algorithmic techniques. 

üìÇ Submissions, solutions and problem instances from the competition will be open-sourced, to lower barriers, promote dissemination and enable further advancements.

## Eligibility and Prizes ![r2](./external_page_resource/robots/robot_racewinner_s.png)

Participation is open to individuals and teams of individuals from any discipline and background and from any geographic location. Financial prizes (in $USD) are available for **distinguished performance** üèÜ:

> - **üí∞ $5,000 cash prizes in the Combined Track!**
> - **üí∏ $2,500 cash prizes in the Path Planning Track!**
> - **üí∏ $2,500 cash prizes in the Task Scheduling Track!**

Other notable performances (2nd, 3rd place in each category) will be recognised with a certificate.
