## Join the Competition ![r10](external_page_resource/robots/r10_s.png)

Login to the competition from the [My Submission](./submission) page. You'll need
a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, so make sure you have one of those first! 

After login, we will automatically create a private GitHub repository on your
behalf. This is where you upload and store your submission source codes during
the competition period. 
Visit the `My Submission` page and click `My Repo` to access your repository. 

If you're competing as a team, you can also add additional members and give
them access too. Just navigate to the `Settings` page (in the `My Submissions`
menu) and add their contact details. 

## Clone Your Submission Repo

the [My Submission](./submission) page. Now you can clone the repo to your
local machine:

```
$ git clone <private git link>
```
