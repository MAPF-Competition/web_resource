## ðŸ”¥ The main round is here! ðŸ”¥ `28 Aug 2023`

**Hello Robot Runners!**

We're excited to announce that the main round of the competition has arrived! In this newsletter, weâ€™re going to tell you whatâ€™s new, whatâ€™s changed, and what it means for your team and your submissions. Letâ€™s dive together into the heart of the challenge!

**1. Main Round:**

The main round officially kicks off on August 29! Building on the successful test round, we have introduced a variety of new and exciting problems, giving you more opportunities to showcase your skills in a wider variety of settings.

As before, we evaluate submissions on each of our 5 test maps, for up to 5000 time steps. However, performance will now be evaluated across 10 different instances:


- 5 instances of high-density problems on our small Random map. Prepare to push your coordination skills to the limit as you navigate your robots through highly congested spaces. Can you maintain order amid all the chaos?


- 2 instances of industry-scale problems on our City map. Similar in size to some real-world applications, these problems raise the stakes: by adding more robots to a larger and more challenging path-planning environment. Adapt your strategies to maintain a winning edge!


- 3 instances of large-scale problems on our Game, Warehouse and Sortation maps. Designed to push the limits of current applications, these problems ask you to plan for many thousands of robots in a fiercely contested environment. With a challenge this intense youâ€™ll have to step up your game!

**2. Enhanced Website Features:**

Weâ€™ve introduced a new leaderboard to keep track of your submissions and all the latest standings. You can now also explore archived submissions, from the test round. These enhancements give further insights into your performance, that of other teams and everyoneâ€™s progress in the competition.

**3. Updated Start-Kit (Version 1.1.1):**

We have a new release of the Start-Kit code available from the competition repository. This release features a variety of improvements, enhancement and bug fixes:


- *More Example Instances:*
  - We generated a variety of new example problems, to cover the wider range of challenge problems in the main round. These will help you test your submissions and track your progress locally.

- *Additional Documentation:*
  - The README.md file now contains additional descriptions for program inputs, file formats, and dependencies. These clarify questions we received in the test round.
  - Windows users will now find detailed instructions for using our Start-Kit with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).  Now everyone can get started without any hiccups!

- *Bug fixes:*
  - We fixed a bug affecting the interpretation of â€˜Tâ€™ type obstacle tiles

**4. Updated PlanViz (1.2.0):**

We have updated our PlanViz visualiser, with the latest release again available from its home repository. Included in this update are a variety of enhancements:
