We are glad to announce the release of two new resources for the community: the Benchmark Archive and the Code Archive. These repositories gather together all of your best submissions from the 2023 competition, together with all problem instances and all known best solutions. 🥁🥁🥁

These resources will help us to track how much progress we are making on the core challenges associated with planning and coordinating teams of real robots. Researchers in the area (that’s you!) can use these resources to further develop and compare their algorithms against the established state-of-the-art. Meanwhile, newcomers to the area also get a leg up! They can start with working implementations and build their new ideas upon best-known solution techniques.🔥🔥🔥

💯In the [Benchmark Archive](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/Benchmark-Archive), you will find:

* Example instances, released with the start-kit.
* Main round evaluation instances.
* Test round evaluation instances.
* Best-known solutions to all evaluation instances.
* Tables that describe the configuration of each benchmark instance, metrics describing the best-known solution for that instance, links to download the solutions and links to the implementation which produced that solution. 

All the best-known solutions can be downloaded and analysed with [PlanViz](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/PlanViz), our offline visualisation tool (previously open-sourced in 2023).

📂In the [Code Archive](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/Code-Archive), you will find:

* Implementations for the best submission of each team on the final leaderboard of the Fast Mover and Overall Best categories.
* Implementations that produced any best-known solution in the Line Honours category.
* Tables that record the metrics of each archived implementation.

We are also finalising the release of a benchmark generator, which we used to produce all the problem instances.**💪** Once done, we will push an update to the benchmark archive and send a further announcement.📢

* We added a Trend plot for the Line Honours category. This allows you to see more easily who is making progress in the race!
* Fixes for a variety of visual bugs. 

### 2. Software Updates

We have updates for both the Start Kit software and for PlanViz, our offline visualiser. See the [upgrade instructions](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/Start-Kit#upgrade-your-start-kit) and make sure your code is up to date!

Start Kit updates:



* We fixed a small bug affecting participants developing with python.
* We added extra documentation to help participants working with preprocessed data.
* We added extra “Debug and Visualise” documentation, to help participants diagnose and fix problems with their planners. 
* We added different logging levels, which makes it easier to parse and work with output files.
* Refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/Start-Kit/blob/main/Changelog.md) for more details.

PlanViz updates:



* We added agent-based filters which simplify what is being shown. This helps you more easily find agents of interest.
* We improved support for visualising plans with invalid actions. This makes it easier to understand what went wrong and why.
* We added additional documentation, to help you use PlanViz more effectively
* We added support for visualising MAPF (i.e., no rotations) plans, a popular and closely related problem to the problem that we tackle in the competition.
* We added a new Tracker Transfer tool, to convert plans from the MAPF Tracker community website (more on this below!)  to the PlanViz format.
* Again, refer to the [changelog](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/PlanViz/blob/main/Changelog.md) for more details!


### 3. Training Data!

Community resources can be invaluable for researchers. One such resource, that may be of interest to participants in the League of Robot Runners, is the **MAPF Tracker ([http://tracker.pathfinding.ai/](http://tracker.pathfinding.ai/))**. This is a new website and database that records best-known solutions on a range of popular benchmarks for the related Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem. 

MAPF can be understood as a special case of the Robot Runners problem model. In particular, there is only one task per agent and agents do not have any facing direction, which means they do not need to turn. Since the two problems are very similar, insights into one can help improve performance on the other. In this update we explore some ideas for how your team could make use of this new resource.

**Browse the database and be inspired!**

We seeded the MAPF Tracker with a variety of results from recent and state-of-the-art MAPF algorithms, and on grid maps which are similar to those used in the competition. Using the website allows you to compare, in a non-competitive setting, the success rates and achieved costs of different and successful planning techniques. The MAPF Tracker contains a range of metadata for each claim, allowing you to locate relevant papers, follow links to author implementations and build on those ideas to improve your own submissions

**Analyse solutions and learn from the best!**

In addition to summary results the MAPF Tracker also contains a wealth of optimised plans, for thousands of instances and across many different domains. Each plan can be downloaded and visualised in [PlanViz](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/PlanViz) (our offline visualisation tool, developed specifically for the competition) which helps you obtain new insights into the combinatorial challenges at the heart of these problems. Plans can also be downloaded en masse, which means the data could be used for training, to automatically learn new cooperative strategies and to get an edge in the competition

**Chart your own course!**

So far we have suggested a few possible starting points. However, we encourage participants to develop their own ideas and to find new ways of exploiting MAPF data, so as to improve their standing in the League of Robot Runners competition. We look forward to your submissions and to seeing what you can come up with!

Good luck!

## 🔥 The main round is here! 🔥 `30 Aug 2023`

### Hello Robot Runners!

We're excited to announce that the main round of the competition has arrived! In this post we’re going to tell you what’s new, what’s changed, and what it means for your team and your submissions. Let’s dive together into the heart of the challenge!

### 1. Main Round:

The main round officially kicks off on August 30! Building on the successful test round, we have introduced a variety of new and exciting problems, giving you more opportunities to showcase your skills in a wider variety of settings.

As before, we evaluate submissions on each of our 5 test maps, for up to 5000 time steps. However, performance will now be evaluated across 10 different instances in one of three distinct categories:


- **High-density** problems. Prepare to push your coordination skills to the limit as you navigate your robots through very congested spaces. Can you maintain order amid all the chaos?


- **Industry-scale** problems. Similar in size to some real-world applications, these problems raise the stakes: by adding more robots to a larger and more challenging path-planning environment. Adapt your strategies to maintain a winning edge!


- **Large-scale** problems. Designed to push the limits of current applications, these problems ask you to plan for thousands of robots in a fiercely contested environment. With a challenge this intense you’ll have to up your game!

### 2. Enhanced Website Features:

We’ve introduced a new leaderboard to keep track of your submissions and all the latest standings. You can now also explore archived submissions, from the test round. These enhancements give further insights into your performance, that of other teams and everyone’s progress in the competition.

### 3. Updated Start-Kit (Version 1.1.2):

We have a new release of the Start-Kit code available from the competition repository. This release features a variety of improvements, enhancements and bug fixes:


- *More Example Instances:*
  - We generated a variety of new example problems, to cover the wider range of challenge problems in the main round. Different from the evaluation instances, these examples will nevertheless help you test your submissions and track your progress locally.

- *Additional Documentation:*
  - The README.md file now contains additional descriptions for program inputs, file formats, and dependencies. These clarify questions we received in the test round.
  - Windows users will now find detailed instructions for using our Start-Kit with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).  Now everyone can get started without any hiccups!

- *Bug fixes:*
  - We fixed a bug affecting the interpretation of ‘T’ type obstacle tiles
  - We’ve fixed a map-boundary issue affecting some users
  - See the [changelog](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/Start-Kit/blob/v1.1.2/Changelog.md) for further details.

### 4. Updated PlanViz (1.2.0):

We have updated our PlanViz visualiser, with the latest release again available from its home repository. Included in this update are a variety of enhancements:

- Allows user-specified start and end times for visualisation. This improvement allows users to more effectively inspect just the most relevant parts of a generated plan.
- UI performance improvements. 
- Various bug fixes and enhancements
- See the [changelog](https://github.com/MAPF-Competition/PlanViz/blob/v1.2.0/Changelog.md) for further details.

### 5. Important Deadlines:

As previously announced, the deadline for the main round is anytime on November 30th. Pencil this date into your calendar now and add a reminder to avoid disappointment! The date UTC-12, which means any submission on or before 23:59:59 on November 30th will be considered timely and queued for evaluation. 

We're excited to have you with us and we're looking forward to your submissions!
