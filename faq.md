## Frequent Questions ![r11](landing_page_resource/robots/r11_s.png)

**Q: Can I modify the start kit code?**

> No, except for the bits that we explicitly tell you to modify in the start-kit instructions.

**Q: Can one team join the competition with multiple github accounts?**

> No

**Q: Can I be part of more than one team?**

> No

**Q: My team used up all of our training award credits, can we have more?**

> The total number of training awards is limited and for this reason we normally allocate only one award per team. If you believe your situation is exceptional in some way, please email us (although the answer is probably no). 

**Q: Will my implementation been reviewed by organisers?**

>Yes, the organisers will review participants' implementation at the end of the competition.

**Q: How to work in a shared git repo with multiple collaborators?** 
>Our system only allows a single submitter. To work with a team of people on a shared git repo, you can create a separate team repo and add team members there, and link the repo with your local repo through git remote. When it is time to submit, you can add your competition repo as a new remote, and the nominated submitter can push the changes.
